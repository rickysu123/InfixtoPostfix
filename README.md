# InfixtoPostfix
Uses simple stacks and queues to evaluate mathematical expressions in infix notation.

The program takes in a file from the command line as the first argument and requires an output file as the second argument. The expressions in the files are strings, so the computer has to process it in a different way. The expression is first converted into postfix notation, following the order of operations. This is done with stacks and queues. The expression is then evaluated. The postfix notation and the answer to each expression is then written into the output file.

Also evaluates boolean values with '0' corresponding to false and '1' as true.
